# Main code

- Sort out convergence issues in SEPP code
   - See comment on GitHub
- Look at the grid-based SEPP method which seems to perform badly


# GUI

- Predictors:
  - Do other predictors
  - Tests for the predictors (just test that the settings we _think_ we are applying get passed to the main `open_cp` code correctly.)

- geo_clip:
  - Use in the run_analysis code (see below...)

- Add a new run stage after running the predictions to run comparisons.
  - The geometry clip should be the first stage of this.
  - Add a simple "hit rate" comparator as a "test" of this.
- Add a new "view comparison" view (to parallel the "Run @ ..." button) to view this output

- Session saving/loading
  - New dialog to select a recent session
