# Main code

- Could think about how best to produce a "prediction" from an SEPP method:
  - Say we want predict the next week.  Is a "point" estimate appropriate, or should we somehow "integrate" over time??



- Can we speed up the cts -> grid predictition sampling??


# GUI

- When viewing the results of an "analysis run" there is a chain of combo boxes behaving in a
  certain way.  Abstract this into a class...  And then use for viewing results of comparisons.
