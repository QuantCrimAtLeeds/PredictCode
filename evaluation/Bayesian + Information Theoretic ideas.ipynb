    "As before, we assume that the events occuring in the \"validation period\" (the e.g. next day after the prediction) are well approximated by an [Inhomogeneous Poisson point process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_point_process#Inhomogeneous_Poisson_point_process) with overall rate $\\lambda$ (the expected number of events in the validation period) and a probability density function $f$, defined on the region of interest $\\Omega$, which gives the local intensity.  This means that in a region $A$, the expected number of events is $\\lambda \\int_A f$.  The overall likelihood function is\n",

    "where the first term comes from the [Poisson distribution](poisson distribution).  In particular, conditioned upon $n$, the location of the events $(x_i)$ are independent from one another.\n",

    "Then, conditional on $n$, each $x_i$ will occur in region $\\Omega_k$ with probability $q_k$, independently.  If $n_k$ denotes the _number_ of events we see in $\\Omega_k$, then $(n_k)_{k=1}^K$ will be distributed as a [Multinomial distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multinomial_distribution), so\n",
